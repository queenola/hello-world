# Hello-world
This is about my first web profile.

Hello to all developers world wide,
My name is RUKAYAT KAREEM,
I am a front-end web dev @ START INNOVATION HUB,
I am passionate about creating a better world with the use of technology ,
As a woman,the whole world tend to think less of us when it comes technology
but I'm here to prove them wrong,like its known women are multi-taskers,
we can actually do more than just being a mother for children,
we can become mothers of technology!
all it takes is ONE WOMAN at a time to lift another woman!
as a woman in tech i would love to encourage other women out there to think beyond!
have no fear! because you never know what you can achieve if until you try!
